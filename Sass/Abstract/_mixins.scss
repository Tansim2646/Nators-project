//By using content directive we can pass value to mixins @content. This allows us to pass block of code to mixin
// if we want to pass a single value to mixin we can use parenthesis for that  but if we want to pass a block of code for that case we have to use content.
//we have to learn Saas directives
// in media query we can't use rem or px because here the font size comes from the browsers end. So it is always ideal to write the font size in em's to be efficient.
//Mixin fucntion should be written from bigger to smaller fromat for Desktop first approach and smaller to bigger for mobile-first approach.
//The order in which we should write media query is 
// Order:: base+typography > general layout+grid > page layout > components
